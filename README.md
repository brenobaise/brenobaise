  I hold a <b>BEng in Software Engineering</b> from the University of Westminster and currently call London home — I've been here for 15 years!

  My journey into programming started with a childhood fascination for the game 
  <a href="https://www.tibia.com/news/?subtopic=latestnews" target="_blank">Tibia</a> (yes, that nostalgic old-school feel 😊). 
  Playing on a private server not only sparked my interest, but also led me to help out with bug fixes using 
  <a href="https://www.lua.org/" target="_blank">LUA</a> — my very first programming language. Interestingly, LUA was developed by a university in my native country, Brazil.
