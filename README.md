### A bit about me

<p align="center">
  I am an Italian Brazillian living in the United Kingdom, London for 15 years. <br>
  I have a BEng degree in Software Engineering with First Class Honours @ the University of Westminster.

When I am not working, I spend my time mostly learning about the Spring Ecosystem and deepening my knowledge in Java. Whenever I have spare time I also enjoying learning about new technologies, mostly through books.

I also enjoy playing games whenever I am cooking for my wife, or going out with her ðŸ˜‚
