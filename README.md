### A bit about me

<p align="center">
  I am an Italian Brazilian living in London, United Kingdom, for the past 15 years. <br><br>
  I hold a BEng degree in Software Engineering with First Class Honours from the University of Westminster. <br><br>
  When I am not working, I spend my time mostly learning about the Spring Ecosystem and deepening my knowledge of Java. <br><br>
  Whenever I have spare time, I also enjoy learning about new technologies, mostly through books. <br><br>
  I also enjoy playing games, cooking for my wife, or going out with her ðŸ˜‚
